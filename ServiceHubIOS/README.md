## ServiceHub iOS (SwiftUI) – Incremental Migration

This folder is a **separate iOS codebase** for incrementally converting the existing ServiceHub web app into a **native iOS app**.

**Rules honored:**
- Web code is the source of truth
- No web files are modified/deleted/refactored
- iOS is built screen-by-screen using SwiftUI + MVVM

### Current scope implemented
- Customer Dashboard (UI + MVVM) using mock data (compilable)

### Next screens (pending your confirmation)

- Profile
- Subscription Plans
